Minecraft Fabric Mod - Remote Shell Command
Project Type: Minecraft 1.21 Fabric Mod
Language: Java 21
Gradle: 8.10
Loom: 1.8-SNAPSHOT
Purpose: Educational/Penetration Testing Tool
Description:
This mod adds a custom /shell <ip> command to Minecraft that establishes a reverse PowerShell connection to a specified IP address on port 1337.
Key Features:

Custom Command Registration: Uses Fabric's command API to register /shell command
String Obfuscation: PowerShell payload is encrypted using XOR + Base64 encoding to avoid detection
Operator Permission: Requires OP level 2 to execute the command

Technical Components:

ShellMod.java - Main mod initializer, registers command on server start
ShellCommand.java - Command logic, decrypts and executes PowerShell payload
StringObfuscator.java - Decryption utility for obfuscated strings
ProcessBuilder - Launches PowerShell with execution policy bypass

Security Note:
This is a proof-of-concept tool for authorized penetration testing and educational purposes only. The reverse shell functionality should only be used on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
